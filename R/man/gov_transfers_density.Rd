\description{
The \code{gov_transfers_density} data contains data from Manacorda, Miguel, and Vigorito (2011) on government transfer program that was administered based on an income cutoff. As opposed to the \code{gov_transfers} data set, this data set only contains income information, but has a wider range of it, for use with density discontinuity tests.

This data is used in the \emph{Regression Discontinuity} chapter of \emph{The Effect}.
