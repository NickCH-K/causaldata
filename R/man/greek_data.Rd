\description{
\code{greek_data} is a fictional data set from Table 2.2 in Chapter 2 of Causal Inference. From the book: "Table 2.2 shows the data from our heart transplant randomized study. Besides data on treatment A (1 if the individual received a transplant, 0 otherwise) and outcome Y (1 if the individual died, 0 otherwise), Table 2.2 also contains data on the prognostic factor L (1 if the individual was in critical condition, 0 otherwise), which we measured before treatment was assigned."
