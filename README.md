# causaldata

This repository will contain R, Stata, and Python packages, all called `causaldata`, which contain data sets that can be used to implement the code examples in causal inference textbooks.

As of the moment, this only contains data sets from [The Effect](http://www.nickchk.com/causalitybook.html) by Huntington-Klein.

Data sets all come with documentation in the form of variable labels, although the exact format of this varies from language to language.

The R package can be installed with:

```r
# If necessary: install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('NickCH-K/causaldata/R/')
```
