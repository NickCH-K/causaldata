{synopt:{opt clear}} Clear the current data before opening the new one.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt download}} {cmd:usecausaldata} will attempt to find {opt dataset} in the adopath, and then in the working directory. If it can't find it, it will try to download it, and will prompt the user to confirm. If {opt download} is specified, the prompt will be skipped and any necessary data will be auto-downloaded.{p_end}
{synopt:{opt wd}} Leave all the downloaded data sets in the working directory rather than moving them to the adopath.{p_end}

{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:usecausaldata} locates data sets that can be downloaded and accessed with the {cmd:causaldata} package, and if it can't find them, downloads them for you and attempts to place them in the adopath.
{p_end}

{pstd}
Most of the time you won't be using {cmd:usecausaldata} directly, and will instead just use {cmd:causaldata} with the {opt use} option.
